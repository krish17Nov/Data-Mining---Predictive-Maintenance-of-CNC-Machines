About Dataset
Made in the COMPETENCE CENTER IN MANUFACTURING (CCM), a laboratory of the AERONAUTICS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (ITA).

Overall
This dataset was produced within a Master's Dissertation work---document fully available to download---consisting of two experiments---Exp1 and Exp2---based on turning an AISI H13 steel with cutting fluid. The first experiment with theoretically new-tool conditions produced 324 samples for each measured roughness parameter. The second with the cutting tool flank wear varying in three levels produced 288 samples for each measured roughness parameter.

At Exp1 and Exp2, the surface roughness was measured on six different spots after each machining run. Therefore, the other variables---including machining forces---are repeated five times at each condition. For example, the first six rows of Exp1.csv show the same condition (4), with varying roughness parameters (and roughness measurement position), and all the other values are repeated.
